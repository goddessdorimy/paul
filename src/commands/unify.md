<objective>
Reconcile plan versus actual results, create SUMMARY.md, and close the loop.

**When to use:** After APPLY phase complete. This is MANDATORY - never skip UNIFY.

Creates SUMMARY.md documenting what was built, decisions made, and any deferred issues.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.opencode/paul-framework/workflows/unify-phase.md
@~/.opencode/paul-framework/templates/SUMMARY.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Plan path: $ARGUMENTS

@.paul/STATE.md
@{plan-path} (the PLAN.md being unified)
</context>

<process>

<step name="validate_preconditions">
1. Confirm PLAN.md exists at $ARGUMENTS path
2. Confirm APPLY phase was executed (tasks completed)
3. If SUMMARY.md already exists: "Loop already closed. SUMMARY: {path}"
</step>

<step name="reconcile">
Follow workflow: @~/.opencode/paul-framework/workflows/unify-phase.md

Compare plan to actual:
- Which tasks completed as planned?
- Any deviations from plan?
- Decisions made during execution?
- Issues discovered but deferred?
</step>

<step name="create_summary">
Create SUMMARY.md in same directory as PLAN.md:
- Document what was built
- Record acceptance criteria results
- Note any deferred issues
- Capture decisions made
- List files created/modified
</step>

<step name="update_state">
Update STATE.md:
- Loop position: PLAN ✓ → APPLY ✓ → UNIFY ✓
- Phase progress if plan completes phase
- Performance metrics (duration)
- Session continuity (next action)
</step>

<step name="report">
Display:
```

<success_criteria>
- [ ] SUMMARY.md created
- [ ] STATE.md updated with loop closure
- [ ] User knows next action
