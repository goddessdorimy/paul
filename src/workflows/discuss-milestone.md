<purpose>
Facilitate vision articulation before creating a milestone. Acts as a thinking partner to explore what the user wants to build, then creates MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md for handoff to create-milestone.

**Philosophy:** Features first — everything else (scope, phases, constraints) derives from what the user wants to build.
</purpose>

<when_to_use>
- User completed previous milestone, considering what's next
- User wants to think through scope before committing
- User has rough ideas but needs to articulate them
- Before /paul-milestone when planning is desired
</when_to_use>

<loop_context>
N/A - This is a pre-planning workflow, not a loop phase.
After discussion, routes to /paul-milestone (create-milestone).
</loop_context>

<required_reading>
@.paul/STATE.md
@.paul/PROJECT.md (current requirements and progress)
@.paul/MILESTONES.md (previous milestone accomplishments, if exists)
</required_reading>

<references>
@src/templates/milestone-context.md (handoff format)
</references>

<process>

<step name="check_state" priority="first">
1. Read STATE.md for current position
2. Read MILESTONES.md (if exists) for prior accomplishments

3. **If active milestone exists:**
   ```
   You have an active milestone: {milestone_name}

   [1] Complete current milestone first
   [2] Start discussion for NEXT milestone (plan ahead)
   ```
   Wait for decision.

4. **If no active milestone:**
   - Display: "Let's define your next milestone."
   - Proceed to milestone_context step
</step>

<step name="milestone_context">
**Present prior accomplishments (if any):**

```
════════════════════════════════════════
MILESTONE DISCUSSION
════════════════════════════════════════

{If MILESTONES.md exists:}
Previous milestone: {last_milestone_name}
Accomplishments:
- {accomplishment_1}
- {accomplishment_2}
- {accomplishment_3}

{If PROJECT.md has validated requirements:}
Shipped so far:
- {validated_requirement_1}
- {validated_requirement_2}

{If PROJECT.md has active requirements:}
Still planned:
- {active_requirement_1}
- {active_requirement_2}

────────────────────────────────────────
```

This gives user context for the discussion.
</step>

<step name="explore_features">
**The core question — features first:**

```
What do you want to build next?

Don't worry about phases or structure yet — just describe the features,
capabilities, or improvements you have in mind.

(Examples: "Add milestone management", "Fix auth flow and add OAuth",
 "Build dashboard with real-time updates")
```

Wait for user response.

**Follow-up if needed:**
- "Any other features you're considering?"
- "What's the main problem this solves?"
- "What would 'done' look like for this?"

Store responses as `features` list.
</step>

<step name="synthesize_scope">
From the features discussed, derive:

1. **Milestone name/version:**
   - Infer from features (e.g., "Auth features" → "v0.4 Authentication")
   - Or ask: "What would you call this milestone?"

2. **Estimated phases:**
   - Group features into logical phases
   - Typical: 2-4 phases per milestone
   - Ask: "Does this grouping make sense? {phase_breakdown}"

3. **Constraints:**
   - Derive from discussion
   - Ask: "Any constraints or limitations to keep in mind?"

4. **Theme (one sentence):**
   - Synthesize: "So the focus is: {theme}. Sound right?"

Confirm with user before proceeding.
</step>

<step name="write_context">
Create `.paul/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md`:

```markdown
# Milestone Context

**Generated:** {date}
**Status:** Ready for /paul-milestone

## Features to Build

{features as bullets with descriptions}

## Scope

**Suggested name:** {milestone_name}
**Estimated phases:** {phase_count}
**Focus:** {theme}

## Phase Mapping

| Phase | Focus | Features |
|-------|-------|----------|
| {next_phase} | {focus} | {features} |

## Constraints

{constraints as bullets}

## Additional Context

<step name="handoff">
Route to create-milestone:

```
════════════════════════════════════════
DISCUSSION COMPLETE

Milestone: {milestone_name}

Context saved for handoff.

────────────────────────────────────────
▶ NEXT: /paul-milestone
  Create the milestone structure from this context

Type "yes" to proceed, or continue discussing.
```

**Accept:** "yes", "go", "create" → run `/paul-milestone`
</step>

</process>

<output>
- .paul/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md created (handoff file)
- Features, scope, and phases articulated
- Ready for /paul-milestone to consume
</output>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Prior accomplishments presented (if any)
- [ ] Features explored (user-driven)
- [ ] Scope synthesized from features
- [ ] Phase mapping suggested
- [ ] MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md written
- [ ] Clear handoff to /paul-milestone
</success_criteria>

<anti_patterns>
**Asking abstract questions first:**
DON'T: "What's the scope of the next milestone?"
DO: "What do you want to build?"

**Assuming phases before features:**
DON'T: "How many phases do you want?"
DO: Derive phases from the features discussed.

**Skipping confirmation:**
DON'T: Write context immediately after one question.
DO: Confirm the synthesis makes sense before writing.

**Not persisting context:**
DON'T: End discussion without writing MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md
DO: Always write the file so /clear doesn't lose progress.
</anti_patterns>

<error_handling>
**User unsure what to build:**
- Reference PROJECT.md active requirements
- Suggest: "What's the most painful thing right now?"
- Offer: "We can start with one feature and expand"

**Scope too large:**
- Suggest splitting: "That sounds like 2-3 milestones"
- Ask: "What's the minimum viable version?"

**User wants to skip discussion:**
- Route directly to /paul-milestone
- Note: "Going straight to milestone creation — no discussion context will be available"
</error_handling>
