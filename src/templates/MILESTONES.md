### Delivered
**Purpose:** One-sentence summary of what shipped.
**Keep it:** User-focused, outcome-oriented.

### Phases completed

**Example:** `5-7 (4 plans total)` or `8.5-8.7 (3 plans total)` for decimal phases

### Key accomplishments
**Count:** 3-5 major achievements.
**Focus:** User-visible features, technical capabilities, quality improvements.
**Avoid:** Implementation details, internal refactors (unless significant).

### Stats
**Purpose:** Quantify the work for historical reference.
**Collect via:**
- Files: `git diff --stat feat(XX-XX)..feat(YY-YY) | tail -1`
- LOC: Count primary language (varies by project)
- Phases/Plans: Count from ROADMAP.md
- Duration: Days from first commit to ship

### Git range
**Purpose:** Reproducible reference to milestone commits.
**Format:** First commit → last commit of milestone.

### What's next
**Purpose:** Link to future work.
**Options:**
- Next milestone goal: "v0.3 Roadmap & Milestone Management"

## Guidelines

### When to create milestones

**DO create for:**
- Initial MVP shipped (v1.0)
- Major version releases (v2.0, v3.0)
- Significant feature milestones (v1.1, v1.2)
- Before archiving planning (capture what was shipped)

**DON'T create for:**
- Individual phase completions (normal workflow)
- Work in progress (wait until shipped)
- Minor bug fixes that don't constitute a release

### Ordering

Entries are **reverse chronological** — newest milestone at top.

### Decimal phases

Include decimal phases in the range when relevant:
- "Phases completed: 8-8.7 (5 plans total)" — includes 8, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7
