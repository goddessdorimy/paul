<purpose>
Create HANDOFF.md file and update STATE.md when pausing work mid-session. Enables seamless resumption in fresh session with full context restoration.
</purpose>

<when_to_use>
- Before ending a session (planned or context limit approaching)
- Switching to different project
- Context window at DEEP or CRITICAL bracket
- User explicitly pauses work
</when_to_use>

<loop_context>
Any position in PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY loop. Captures state regardless of where loop is.
</loop_context>

<step name="detect_position" priority="first">
1. Read `.paul/STATE.md` to get:
   - Current phase and plan
   - Loop position (PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY markers)
   - Last activity
2. Identify current working directory:
   ```bash
   ls -t .paul/phases/*/PLAN*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
   ```
</step>

<step name="gather_session_context">
**Collect complete state for handoff:**

Ask user (or infer from conversation):
1. **Work completed this session** - What got done?
2. **Work in progress** - What's partially done?
3. **Decisions made** - Key choices and rationale
4. **Blockers/issues** - Anything stuck?
5. **Mental context** - The approach, what you were thinking

If user doesn't provide, summarize from:
- Recent file modifications (`git status`)
- Conversation history
- STATE.md changes
</step>

<step name="create_handoff">
**Create HANDOFF file:**

```bash
# Generate filename
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
HANDOFF_FILE=".paul/HANDOFF-${TIMESTAMP}.md"
```

**Write content (NOT from template, populate directly):**

```markdown
# PAUL Handoff

**Date:** [current timestamp]
**Status:** [paused/blocked/context-limit]

---

## READ THIS FIRST

You have no prior context. This document tells you everything.

**Project:** [from PROJECT.md]
**Core value:** [from PROJECT.md]

---

## Current State

**Version:** [from STATE.md]
**Phase:** [N] of [total] — [phase name]
**Plan:** [plan-id] — [status]

**Loop Position:**
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY
  [✓/○]    [✓/○]    [✓/○]
```

---

## What Was Done

- [Accomplishment 1]
- [Accomplishment 2]
- [Accomplishment 3]

---

## What's In Progress

- [In-progress item with status]

---

## What's Next

**Immediate:** [specific next action]

**After that:** [following action]

---

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.paul/STATE.md` | Live project state |
| `.paul/ROADMAP.md` | Phase overview |
| [current plan path] | [plan purpose] |

---

## Resume Instructions

1. Read `.paul/STATE.md` for latest position
2. Check loop position
3. Run `/paul:resume` or `/paul:progress`

---

*Handoff created: [timestamp]*
```

Be specific enough for a fresh Claude to understand immediately.
</step>

<step name="update_state">
**Update `.paul/STATE.md` Session Continuity section:**

```markdown
## Session Continuity

Last session: [timestamp]
Stopped at: [what was happening]
Next action: [clear directive]
Resume file: .paul/HANDOFF-[date].md
Resume context:
- [bullet 1 - key context]
- [bullet 2 - key context]
- [bullet 3 - key context]
```
</step>

<step name="optional_commit">
**If git repo, offer to commit as WIP:**

```bash
git add .paul/HANDOFF-*.md .paul/STATE.md
git commit -m "wip: paused at [phase]-[plan]"
```

Ask user before committing.
</step>

<step name="confirm">
**Display confirmation:**

```
════════════════════════════════════════
PAUL SESSION PAUSED
════════════════════════════════════════

Handoff created: .paul/HANDOFF-[date].md

Current State:
  Phase: [N] of [M]
  Plan: [status]
  Loop: [PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY position]

To resume later:
  /paul:resume

════════════════════════════════════════
```
</step>

</process>

<output>
- HANDOFF-{date}.md created in .paul/
- STATE.md updated with session continuity
- Optional WIP commit
- User knows how to resume
</output>

<error_handling>
**No .paul/ directory:**
- "No PAUL project found. Nothing to pause."

**STATE.md missing or corrupted:**
- Create minimal handoff from available context
- Note the gap in handoff file

**Git not available:**
- Skip commit step, still create handoff
</error_handling>

## GSD Parity Documentation

### Source Reference
- **GSD File:** `commands/gsd/pause-work.md`

### Adapted from GSD
- `.continue-here.md` concept → PAUL uses `HANDOFF-{date}.md`
- Structured handoff sections
- WIP commit pattern
- Confirmation display

### PAUL Innovations
- **Centralized handoff:** GSD puts `.continue-here.md` in phase directory; PAUL keeps `HANDOFF-*.md` in `.paul/` root for easier discovery
- **Dated naming:** `HANDOFF-{date}.md` allows multiple handoffs without overwriting
- **Loop position capture:** Explicitly captures PLAN/APPLY/UNIFY state
- **Direct content:** Populates content directly, not from placeholder template
