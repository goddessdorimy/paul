## Status Lifecycle

```
Draft ──▶ Reviewed ──▶ Integrated
  │          │            │
  │          │            └── Findings used in plan/code
  │          └── Main session vetted findings
  └── Fresh from subagent
```

**Draft:** Subagent just completed research
**Reviewed:** Main session has vetted and confirmed findings
**Integrated:** Findings have been incorporated into plans or code

## Usage Pattern

1. User runs `/paul-research <topic>`
2. Workflow spawns appropriate subagent
3. Subagent researches and returns findings
4. RESEARCH.md created with status: Draft
5. Main session reviews findings
6. Status updated to Reviewed when vetted
7. Status updated to Integrated when used
