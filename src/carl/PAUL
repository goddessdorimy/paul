# CARL Domain: PAUL (Plan-Apply-Unify Loop)
# AI-assisted development workflow. Activates when .paul/ exists in project.
PAUL_STATE=active
PAUL_ALWAYS_ON=false

# Rule 0: Scope
PAUL_RULE_0=PAUL governs structured AI development via Plan-Apply-Unify loop. Requires .paul/ directory.

# MUST (critical)
PAUL_RULE_1=No implementation code without approved PLAN.md. Research/exploration OK. Violation = stop, request approval.
PAUL_RULE_2=Every APPLY must be followed by UNIFY. UNIFY reconciles plan vs actual, updates STATE.md, logs decisions.
PAUL_RULE_3=Respect PLAN.md "Boundaries" / "DO NOT CHANGE" sections. Stop and confirm before modifying protected items.
PAUL_RULE_4=When blocked: document in STATE.md Blockers, notify human, await approval before workarounds.

# SHOULD (quality)
PAUL_RULE_5=Tasks require verification criteria: <verify>[proof of success]</verify>. No verify = cannot complete.
PAUL_RULE_6=Log all APPLY deviations: what, why, downstream impact. Audit trail for UNIFY.
PAUL_RULE_7=Use BDD acceptance criteria: Given [precondition] / When [action] / Then [outcome].

# MAY (patterns)
PAUL_RULE_8=Size tasks for single session (~50% context). Split larger tasks during planning.
PAUL_RULE_9=One commit per phase at transition. Format: {type}({phase}): {description}. WIP commits optional at pause. Version alignment required at milestone.
PAUL_RULE_10=Urgent work uses decimal phases (2.1, 2.2). Integers = planned, decimals = interruptions.

# PARITY
PAUL_RULE_11=After creating PAUL artifacts: cite GSD equivalent, note adaptations, document innovations.
