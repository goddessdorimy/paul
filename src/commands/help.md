# PAUL Command Reference

**PAUL** (Plan-Apply-Unify Loop) is a structured AI-assisted development framework for opencode.

## The Loop

Every unit of work follows this cycle:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY          │
│                                     │
│  Define    Execute    Reconcile     │
│  work      tasks      & close       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Never skip UNIFY.** Every plan needs a summary.

## Quick Start

1. `/paul-init` - Initialize PAUL in your project
2. `/paul-plan` - Create a plan for your work
3. `/paul-apply` - Execute the approved plan
4. `/paul-unify` - Close the loop with summary

- Prompts for project context and phases
- Optionally configures integrations (SonarQube, etc.)

Usage: `/paul-init`

---

### `/paul-plan [phase]`
Enter PLAN phase - create an executable plan.

- Reads current state from STATE.md
- Creates PLAN.md with tasks, acceptance criteria, boundaries
- Populates skills section from SPECIAL-FLOWS.md (if configured)
- Updates loop position

Usage: `/paul-plan` (auto-detects next phase)
Usage: `/paul-plan 3` (specific phase)

---

### `/paul-apply [plan-path]`
Execute an approved PLAN.md file.

- **Blocks if required skills not loaded** (from SPECIAL-FLOWS.md)
- Validates plan exists and hasn't been executed
- Executes tasks sequentially
- Handles checkpoints (decision, human-verify, human-action)

Usage: `/paul-apply`
Usage: `/paul-apply .paul/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

---

### `/paul-unify [plan-path]`
Reconcile plan vs actual and close the loop.

- Creates SUMMARY.md documenting what was built
- Audits skill invocations (if SPECIAL-FLOWS.md configured)
- Records decisions made, deferred issues
- Updates STATE.md with loop closure
- **Required** - never skip this step

Usage: `/paul-unify`
Usage: `/paul-unify .paul/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

---

### `/paul-help`
Show this command reference.

Usage: `/paul-help`

---

### `/paul-status` *(deprecated)*
> Use `/paul-progress` instead.

Shows current loop position. Deprecated in favor of `/paul-progress` which provides better routing.

---

## Session Commands

| `auto` | Fully autonomous execution |
| `checkpoint:decision` | Choices requiring human input |
| `checkpoint:human-verify` | Visual/functional verification |
| `checkpoint:human-action` | Manual steps (rare) |

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**
```
/paul-init
/paul-plan
# Approve plan
/paul-apply
/paul-unify
```

**Checking where you are:**
```
/paul-progress   # State + ONE next action (recommended)
```

**Resuming work (new session):**
```
/paul-resume     # Restores context, suggests next action
```

**Pausing work (before break):**
```
/paul-pause      # Creates handoff, updates state
```

**Pre-planning exploration:**
```
/paul-discuss 3       # Articulate vision
/paul-assumptions 3   # See opencode's assumptions
/paul-research "topic"  # Gather external info
/paul-plan 3          # Now create the plan
```

**Managing roadmap:**
```
/paul-add-phase "New Feature"    # Add phase
/paul-remove-phase 5             # Remove future phase
/paul-milestone "v2.0"           # Create milestone
/paul-complete-milestone         # Archive milestone
```

## Key Principles

1. **Loop must complete** - PLAN -> APPLY -> UNIFY, no shortcuts
2. **Commands are thin** - Logic lives in workflows
3. **State is tracked** - STATE.md knows where you are
4. **Boundaries are real** - Respect DO NOT CHANGE sections
5. **Acceptance criteria first** - Define done before starting
6. **Skills are enforced** - Required skills block APPLY until loaded

## Getting Help

- Run `/paul-progress` to see where you are and what to do next
- Read `.paul/PROJECT.md` for project context
- Read `.paul/STATE.md` for current position
- Check `.paul/ROADMAP.md` for phase overview
