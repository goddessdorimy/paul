<purpose>
Facilitate vision articulation before planning a phase. Acts as a thinking partner to explore what the user wants to accomplish, then creates CONTEXT.md for handoff to plan-phase.

**Philosophy:** Goals first — everything else (approach, constraints, risks) derives from what the user wants to achieve.

**Distinction from assumptions:** This workflow gathers USER input about the phase. The assumptions workflow surfaces opencode's understanding for validation.
</purpose>

<when_to_use>
- User starting a new phase and wants to think through approach
- User has rough ideas but needs to articulate them before planning
- Before /paul-plan when discussion is desired
- Phase scope is unclear or has multiple possible approaches
</when_to_use>

<loop_context>
N/A - This is a pre-planning workflow, not a loop phase.
After discussion, routes to /paul-plan (plan-phase).
</loop_context>

<required_reading>
@.paul/STATE.md
@.paul/PROJECT.md (current requirements and progress)
@.paul/ROADMAP.md (phase scope and goals)

<step name="validate_phase" priority="first">
1. Parse phase number from $ARGUMENTS

**If argument missing:**
```
Error: Phase number required.

Usage: /paul-discuss <phase-number>
Example: /paul-discuss 10
```
Exit workflow.

2. Validate phase exists in ROADMAP.md
3. Extract phase details: number, name, description, scope

**If phase not found:**
```
Error: Phase {N} not found in roadmap.

Available phases:
[list incomplete phases from roadmap]
```
Exit workflow.
</step>

<step name="phase_context">
**Present phase context:**

```
════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE DISCUSSION
════════════════════════════════════════

Phase: {phase_number} — {phase_name}
Status: {from ROADMAP.md}

Roadmap description:
{phase description from ROADMAP.md}

{If prior phase completed:}
Prior phase: {prior_phase_name}
What was built: {summary}

────────────────────────────────────────
```

This gives user context for the discussion.
</step>

<step name="explore_goals">
**The core question — goals first:**

```
What do you want to accomplish in this phase?

Don't worry about implementation details yet — just describe what
success looks like and any specific goals you have in mind.

(Examples: "Get research workflows working", "Make the CLI intuitive",
 "Ensure proper error handling")
```

Wait for user response.

**Follow-up if needed:**
- "Any specific features or capabilities you're prioritizing?"
- "What's the most important outcome?"
- "Any concerns or risks you want to address?"

Store responses as `goals` list.
</step>

<step name="explore_approach">
**Ask about approach:**

```
How do you want to approach this phase?

Consider:
- Any specific patterns or libraries to use/avoid?
- Constraints or limitations?
- Dependencies on other work?
```

Wait for user response.

Store responses as `approach` notes.
</step>

<step name="synthesize_context">
From the discussion, derive:

1. **Key goals:**
   - Synthesize main objectives from discussion
   - Confirm: "So the main goals are: {goals}. Sound right?"

2. **Approach notes:**
   - Capture technical direction
   - Note any constraints mentioned

3. **Open questions:**
   - Identify anything still unclear
   - Note items to research or decide during planning

Confirm with user before proceeding.
</step>

<step name="write_context">
Create `.paul/phases/{NN}-{name}/CONTEXT.md`:

Use CONTEXT.md template format.

Display:
```
Context saved to .paul/phases/{NN}-{name}/CONTEXT.md

This file persists across /clear so you can take a break if needed.
```
</step>

<step name="handoff">
Route to plan-phase:

```
════════════════════════════════════════
DISCUSSION COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════════════

Phase: {phase_number} — {phase_name}
Goals: {goal_count}
Status: Ready for planning

Context saved for handoff.

────────────────────────────────────────
▶ NEXT: /paul-plan
  Create the plan structure from this context
────────────────────────────────────────

Type "yes" to proceed, or continue discussing.
```

**Accept:** "yes", "go", "plan" → run `/paul-plan`
</step>

</process>

<output>
- .paul/phases/{NN}-{name}/CONTEXT.md created (handoff file)
- Goals and approach articulated
- Ready for /paul-plan to consume
</output>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Phase validated against ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Phase context presented
- [ ] Goals explored (user-driven)
- [ ] Approach discussed
- [ ] Context synthesized and confirmed
- [ ] CONTEXT.md written to phase directory
- [ ] Clear handoff to /paul-plan
</success_criteria>

<anti_patterns>
**Asking abstract questions first:**
DON'T: "What's the scope of this phase?"
DO: "What do you want to accomplish?"

**Assuming approach before goals:**
DON'T: "What libraries will you use?"
DO: Derive approach from goals discussed.

**Skipping confirmation:**
DON'T: Write context immediately after one question.
DO: Confirm the synthesis makes sense before writing.

**Not persisting context:**
DON'T: End discussion without writing CONTEXT.md
DO: Always write the file so /clear doesn't lose progress.

**Duplicating assumptions workflow:**
DON'T: Surface opencode's assumptions here.
DO: Focus on user input. Use /paul-assumptions for opencode's analysis.
</anti_patterns>

<error_handling>
**User unsure what to accomplish:**
- Reference ROADMAP.md phase description
- Suggest: "Based on the roadmap, this phase should..."
- Offer: "We can start with the roadmap goals and refine"

**Scope too large:**
- Suggest splitting into multiple plans
- Ask: "What's the most critical part?"

**User wants to skip discussion:**
- Route directly to /paul-plan
- Note: "Going straight to planning — no discussion context will be available"
</error_handling>
