# Milestone Context Template

Template for `.paul/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md` — temporary handoff from discuss-milestone to create-milestone.

**Purpose:** Persist milestone discussion context across `/clear` boundaries. This is a handoff artifact, not permanent documentation.

### Key Points

1. **Created by:** `discuss-milestone` command at end of discussion
2. **Consumed by:** `create-milestone` command
3. **Deleted after:** Milestone successfully created
4. **Not committed:** Exclude from version control (temporary artifact)

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

| Section | Include | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Features | User-facing capabilities to build | Defines milestone substance |
| Scope | Version number, theme, phase count | Frames the work |
| Phase Mapping | Rough feature-to-phase breakdown | Guides create-milestone |
| Constraints | Technical/business limits | Prevents scope creep |
| Additional Context | Discussion notes, decisions | Preserves conversation |

### What NOT to Include

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Technical implementation details | That comes during phase planning |
| Detailed phase specifications | create-milestone handles that |
| Code architecture decisions | Research phase work |
| Exhaustive task lists | PLAN.md level of detail |

**Key principle:** This captures the *what* and *why*, not the *how*.

## Integration with PAUL Workflow

### Before discuss-milestone

```
STATE.md shows: Previous milestone complete
ROADMAP.md shows: Phases complete, next milestone undefined
```

### After discuss-milestone

```
MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md: Created with discussion output
STATE.md: Updated to note milestone discussion complete
```

### After create-milestone

```
MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md: Deleted
ROADMAP.md: Updated with new milestone and phases
STATE.md: Updated with new phase position
```

## Example

```markdown
# Milestone Context

**Generated:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for /paul:create-milestone

## Features to Build

- **Milestone lifecycle commands**: Create, complete, and discuss milestones
- **Roadmap modification commands**: Add and remove phases dynamically
- **Milestone templates**: Entry format, archive format, context handoff

## Scope

**Suggested name:** v0.3 Roadmap & Milestone Management
**Estimated phases:** 3
**Focus:** Complete milestone management tooling for PAUL framework

## Phase Mapping

| Phase | Focus | Features |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 9 | Templates | MILESTONES.md, archive, context templates |
| 10 | Workflows | discuss-milestone, complete-milestone, add-phase |
| 11 | Commands | CLI commands for milestone operations |

## Constraints

- Templates first, then workflows, then commands (dependency order)
- Must follow GSD patterns with PAUL innovations
- Keep commands simple — complex logic in workflows

## Additional Context

- Discussed need for milestone grouping in ROADMAP.md
- User preference for tabular layouts over bullet lists
- Consider optional SonarQube scan before milestone completion

## GSD Parity Documentation

### Source Reference
- **GSD File:** `~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/milestone-context.md`

### Adapted from GSD
- Handoff file concept (discuss → create)
- Lifecycle documentation (create → consume → delete)
- Content sections (features, scope, phase mapping, constraints, notes)
- Clear "do NOT include" guidance
- Template placeholder pattern

### PAUL Innovations Beyond GSD
- **Lifecycle diagram:** Visual flowchart of handoff process
- **Content guidelines table:** Structured include/exclude with rationale
- **Integration section:** How context file connects to STATE.md and ROADMAP.md
- **Version control note:** Explicit "do not commit" guidance
- **Phase mapping table:** Tabular format vs bullet list

### Sources for PAUL Additions
- Lifecycle diagram: Standard workflow documentation
- Integration section: PAUL's emphasis on file relationships
- Table format: Consistent with PAUL's preference for scannable layouts
