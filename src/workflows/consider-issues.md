<purpose>
Review all open issues with current codebase context. Categorize as resolved, urgent, natural-fit, or can-wait. Offer triage actions. Prevents issue pile-up by closing the loop on deferred work.
</purpose>

<when_to_use>
- Before milestone completion (clean up before release)
- Periodically during active development
- When planning new phase (check for natural fits)
- After significant refactoring (issues may be resolved)
</when_to_use>

<process>

<step name="find_issues">
**Locate all issue files:**

1. Check for global issues:
   ```bash
   ls .paul/ISSUES.md 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. Check for phase-scoped UAT files:
   ```bash
   find .paul/phases -name "*-UAT.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. If no issue files found:
   ```
   No issues to review.

   Issue files are created by:
   - Deferred enhancements during development → .paul/ISSUES.md
   - UAT testing findings → .paul/phases/XX-name/{plan}-UAT.md

   All clear - continue with current work.
   ```
   Exit workflow.
</step>

<step name="parse_issues">
**Parse all open issues:**

From ISSUES.md "## Open Issues" section:
- ISS number (ISS-001, ISS-002, etc.)
- Brief description
- Discovered phase/date
- Type (Bug/Enhancement/Technical Debt/UX)
- Effort estimate

From UAT files:
- UAT number (UAT-001, UAT-002, etc.)
- Severity (Blocker/Major/Minor/Cosmetic)
- Related AC
- Description

Build consolidated list with source file reference.
</step>

<step name="analyze_each">
**For each open issue, analyze against codebase:**

1. **Check if still relevant:**
   - Search for related code/files mentioned
   - If code no longer exists or significantly refactored → likely resolved

2. **Check if accidentally resolved:**
   - Look for changes that may have addressed this
   - Check if enhancement was implemented as part of other work

3. **Assess current urgency:**
   - Blocking upcoming phases?
   - Pain point in recent work?
   - Affecting actively-touched code?

4. **Check natural fit:**
   - Aligns with upcoming phase in roadmap?
   - Would touch same files as current work?

**Categorize:**
- **Resolved** - Can be closed (code changed, no longer applicable)
- **Urgent** - Should address before continuing (blocking/problematic)
- **Natural fit** - Good candidate for upcoming phase X
- **Can wait** - Keep deferred, no change in status
</step>

<step name="report">
**Present categorized report:**

```
# Issue Review

**Analyzed:** [N] open issues
**Date:** [today]

## Resolved (can close)

### ISS-XXX: [description]
**Reason:** [Why resolved - code changed, implemented elsewhere]
**Evidence:** [What you found]

---

## Urgent (should address now)

### UAT-XXX: [description]
**Why urgent:** [What changed - blocking, causing problems]
**Recommendation:** Insert plan or add to current phase
**Effort:** [Quick/Medium/Substantial]

---

## Natural Fit for Upcoming Work

### ISS-XXX: [description]
**Fits with:** Phase [X] - [phase name]
**Reason:** [Same files, same subsystem]

---

## Can Wait (no change)

[List issue IDs with brief status]
```
</step>

<step name="offer_actions">
**Offer actions based on findings:**

Use AskUserQuestion with relevant options:

**If resolved issues exist:**
- "Close resolved" - Move to closed section
- "Review each first" - Show details before closing

**If urgent issues exist:**
- "Insert urgent phase" - Create decimal phase (e.g., 10.3)
- "Add to current plan" - Include in next plan
- "Defer anyway" - Keep as-is

**If natural fits exist:**
- "Note for phase" - Update issue with suggested phase
- "Keep as-is" - No annotation needed

**Always include:**
- "Done for now" - Exit without changes
</step>

<step name="execute_actions">
**Execute selected actions:**

**Closing resolved issues:**
1. Move from "## Open Issues" to "## Closed Issues"
2. Add resolution note with date and reason
3. Update STATE.md deferred issues count

**Inserting urgent phase:**
- Suggest command: `/paul-plan 10.3 Address urgent issues [list]`

**Noting for phase:**
- Update issue entry with "Suggested: Phase [X]"
</step>
